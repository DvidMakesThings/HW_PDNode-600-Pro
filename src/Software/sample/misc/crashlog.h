 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-11-06
 *
 * @details
 * This module provides crash logging and diagnostics capabilities for the ENERGIS PDU.
 * It captures and retains critical fault information across system resets in a dedicated
 * noinit RAM section with CRC32 integrity checking.
 *
 * The crash log system provides:
 * - HardFault exception context capture (PC, LR, registers)
 * - Reset cause detection and classification
 * - Monotonic boot counter
 * - Watchdog feed telemetry ring buffer
 * - Software reboot tagging for intentional resets
 * - Post-mortem diagnostics output at boot
 *
 * The crash log structure survives soft resets and watchdog reboots, allowing
 * post-mortem analysis of fault conditions. CRC32 validation ensures data integrity.
