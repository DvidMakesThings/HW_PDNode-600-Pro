 *
 * @details
 * This module provides implementations of FreeRTOS application hooks for fault
 * handling and system monitoring. It captures fault context into watchdog scratch
 * registers for post-mortem analysis and implements an Idle task canary for
 * scheduler liveness detection.
 *
 * Provided functionality:
 * - FreeRTOS hook implementations (Idle, StackOverflow, MallocFailed, Assert)
 * - HardFault exception handler with context capture
 * - Idle task canary for scheduler stall detection
 * - Fault breadcrumb storage in watchdog scratch registers
 *
 * All fault hooks capture minimal context and initiate a controlled reboot to
 * allow post-mortem analysis via the boot diagnostics system.

/**
 * @brief FreeRTOS Idle task hook for scheduler liveness monitoring.
 *
 * This hook is called by the FreeRTOS Idle task during each iteration of its
 * main loop. It increments a global canary counter and records the current
 * RTOS time, providing a mechanism for other tasks (typically HealthTask) to
 * detect scheduler stalls or excessive blocking.
 *
 * The hook must execute quickly and never block, as blocking the Idle task
 * can prevent lower-priority cleanup operations.
 *
 * @return None
 *
 * @note Requires configUSE_IDLE_HOOK=1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h
 * @note Runs at Idle priority; higher priority tasks will preempt it
