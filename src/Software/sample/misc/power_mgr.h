 * @brief Centralized power state management and standby mode control
 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-11-17
 *
 * @details
 * This module provides centralized power state management for the ENERGIS PDU,
 * implementing a software-based standby mode that reduces power consumption and
 * network activity while maintaining system responsiveness for wake events.
 *
 * The power manager maintains a global state that all tasks can query to adapt
 * their behavior between normal operation (RUN) and low-power (STANDBY) modes.
 * State transitions are atomic and coordinated across hardware peripherals.
 *
 * Standby Mode Characteristics:
 * - W5500 Ethernet controller held in hardware reset (PHY disabled, no traffic)
 * - All relay outputs disabled
 * - Display LEDs off except PWR_LED (breathing pattern)
 * - Selection LEDs disabled
 * - Tasks continue executing but skip non-critical operations
 * - Watchdog remains serviced to prevent unexpected resets
 * - System remains responsive to button press wake events
 *
 * Wake from standby is typically triggered by a short press of the power button,
 * which calls Power_ExitStandby() to restore normal operation.
