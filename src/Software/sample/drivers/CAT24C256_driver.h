 * @brief I2C driver for CAT24C256 32KB EEPROM with page-aware write operations.
 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.1.0
 * @date 2025-11-06
 *
 * @details
 * Provides thread-safe access to the CAT24C256 serial EEPROM used for non-volatile
 * parameter storage in the ENERGIS PDU. The driver handles:
 * - 64-byte page boundary management for writes
 * - Mandatory write cycle delays per datasheet timing
 * - 16-bit address space (0x0000 - 0x7FFF, 32KB total)
 * - I2C bus arbitration via centralized bus manager
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Page-aware buffered writes prevent page boundary corruption
 * - Automatic write cycle delays (5ms per page)
 * - Sequential multi-byte reads without page restrictions
 * - Self-test function for hardware validation
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All operations must be called from StorageTask with eepromMtx protection
 * - Uses i2c_bus_* wrappers for serialized I2C access
 *
 * Hardware Configuration:
 * - I2C address: 0x50 (7-bit)
 * - Bus: I2C1 (configurable via CONFIG.h)
 * - Speed: Typically 100-400 kHz

 *   - Chunk 1: 0x0020-0x003F (32 bytes to page boundary)
 *   - Delay 5ms
 *   - Chunk 2: 0x0040-0x007F (64 bytes, full page)

 *   - Chunk 3: 0x0080-0x0083 (4 bytes remaining)
 *   - Delay 5ms

/**
 * @brief Execute comprehensive EEPROM self-test.
 *
 * @details
 * Validates EEPROM functionality by writing and reading back a test
 * pattern designed to detect common failure modes:
 *
 * Test Pattern (8 bytes):
 * - 0xAA, 0x55: Alternating bit patterns (detects stuck bits)
 * - 0xCC, 0x33: Adjacent bit pairs (detects crosstalk)
 * - 0xF0, 0x0F: Nibble patterns (detects partial byte errors)
 * - 0x00, 0xFF: Extreme values (detects threshold issues)
 *
 * Procedure:
 * 1. Write test pattern to specified address
 * 2. Wait 10ms for write completion
 * 3. Read back pattern
 * 4. Compare byte-by-byte with expected values
 *
 * @param test_addr Starting address for test (modifies 8 bytes)
 *
 * @return true if all bytes match expected pattern
 * @return false on write failure, read failure, or data mismatch
 *
 * @warning Overwrites 8 bytes at test_addr
 * @note Thread-safety: Must be called from StorageTask with eepromMtx held
