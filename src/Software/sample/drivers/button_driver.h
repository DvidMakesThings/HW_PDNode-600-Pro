 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-11-06
 *
 * @details
 * This driver provides low-level access to the ENERGIS PDU front panel controls:
 * - Three pushbuttons (PLUS, MINUS, SET) with active-low inputs and pull-ups
 * - Eight channel selection LEDs driven via MCP23017 GPIO expander
 *
 * The driver uses direct GPIO access for button reads and delegates LED control
 * to SwitchTask for thread-safe I2C operations. All functions are non-blocking
 * and safe to call from any task context.
 *
 * Hardware Configuration:
 * - Buttons are active-low with internal pull-ups
 * - Selection LEDs are controlled via SwitchTask message queue
 * - No debouncing is performed (handled by ButtonTask)
