 * @ingroup drivers
 * @brief RTOS-safe driver for HLW8032 power measurement IC
 * @{
 *
 * @version 12.0.0
 * @date 2026-01-07
 *
 * @details RTOS-safe driver for interfacing with HLW8032 power measurement chips.
 * Features:
 * - Mutex-protected UART access for thread safety
 * - Multiplexed channel selection via MCP23017
 * - Hardware v1.0.0 pin swap compensation
 * - Per-channel calibration with EEPROM persistence
 * - Cached measurements and uptime tracking
 * - Total current sum for overcurrent protection
 * - Queue-based logging (no direct printf)
 *
 * Hardware Configuration:
 * - 8 HLW8032 ICs sharing UART0 RX (4800 baud)
 * - Individual TX lines selected by 74HC4051 multiplexer
 * - Multiplexer control via MCP23017 port B (MUX_A/B/C, MUX_EN)
 * - Frame format: 24 bytes starting with 0x55 0x5A
 *
 * Calibration Overview (Async):
 *
 * Purpose
 * - Provide a safe, non-blocking way to calibrate HLW8032 channels while the system
 *   continues normal operation. Results are persisted per-channel to EEPROM.
 *
 * High-level Flow
 * 1) Start (arm state machine)
 *    - ZERO (0V/0A): zero offsets for V and I across one or all channels
 *      Functions: hlw8032_calibration_start_zero_all(), hlw8032_calibration_start_zero_single(ch)
 *    - VOLT (Vref/0A): voltage gain factor using a known mains reference (current ~0A)
 *      Functions: hlw8032_calibration_start_voltage_all(refV),
 * hlw8032_calibration_start_voltage_single(ch, refV)
 *    - CURR (Iref): current gain factor using a known measured current
 *      Functions:
 *        - hlw8032_calibration_start_current_single(ch, refI): single-channel
 *        - hlw8032_calibration_start_current_all(refI): driver sequences all channels
 *    - Single-channel runs reuse the ALL mode internally but limit the window to
 *      current_channel=ch, total_channels=ch+1.
 *
 * 2) Sampling (cooperative)
 *    - Regular calls to hlw8032_read()/hlw8032_poll_once() feed frames to the engine.
 *    - Only valid frames (checksum/state OK) contribute to accumulated sums:
 *      VolPar/VolData and CurPar/CurData.
 *    - Collection stops per-channel after a fixed target: HLW_CAL_SAMPLES_PER_CH (see .c).
 *
 * 3) Finish per channel (compute + persist)
 *    - ZERO mode: measure offsets at 0V/0A
 *      voltage_offset = (VolPar/VolData) * voltage_factor
 *      current_offset = (CurPar/CurData) * current_factor
 *    - VOLT mode: compute new voltage_factor using reference voltage
 *      voltage_factor_new = (Vref + voltage_offset) * (VolData/VolPar)
 *    - CURR mode: compute new current_factor using reference current
 *      current_factor_new = (Iref + current_offset) * (CurData/CurPar)
 *    - The updated per-channel record (factors, offsets, flags) is written immediately to
 *      EEPROM via EEPROM_WriteSensorCalibrationForChannel(ch, &cal).
 *    - On EEPROM write failure, the channel is marked failed; processing continues.
 *
 * 4) Advance or complete (sequence control)
 *    - For ALL-channel runs: advance to the next channel and repeat sampling.
 *    - For single-channel runs: complete and clear the running flag.
 *    - A summary is logged: total ok vs failed channels.
 *
 * Persistence and Load
 * - Each channel’s calibration is committed to EEPROM at the moment its computation finishes.
 * - On boot, hlw8032_load_calibration() loads all channels into RAM, sanitizes values,
 *   and falls back to nominal defaults if reads fail.
 *
 * Concurrency & Safety
 * - Only one calibration can run at a time; starts will fail if already running.
 * - Sampling is cooperative with normal operation (no busy loops); UART access is mutexed.
 * - Power loss mid-run is safe: completed channels are already persisted; incomplete ones
 *   remain unchanged.
 * - Console "ALL" for current calibration invokes
 *   hlw8032_calibration_start_current_all(refI). The driver sequences channels 0..7
 *   internally and the polling loop pins to the active channel to accelerate
 *   sampling. No parallel calibrations are executed. The console may wait on
 *   `hlw8032_calibration_is_running()` until completion.
 *
 * Constraints & Recommendations
 * - ZERO: ensure all relays OFF (0V/0A) on the target channels.
 * - VOLT: ensure a stable mains reference across the selected channels; keep current ~0A.
 * - CURR: apply a known current on the selected channel and measure with a DMM.
 * - Best accuracy: perform ZERO, then VOLT, then CURR (for the needed channels).
 *
 * Monitoring & Control
 * - Check `hlw8032_calibration_is_running()` to see if a sequence is active.
 * - Progress and per-channel results are logged by the driver.
 * - Console commands provide a user-facing interface:
 *   AUTO_CAL_ZERO [ch|ALL]
 *   AUTO_CAL_V <voltage> [ch|ALL]
 *   AUTO_CAL_I <current> <ch|ALL>
 *   Note: For current calibration with ALL, the console handler blocks between
 *   channels while the async engine runs each channel to completion.
 *
 * Timing
 * - Total time depends on HLW_CAL_SAMPLES_PER_CH and UART throughput (4800 baud) and
 *   the poll cadence. Expect a short per-channel dwell while samples accumulate.
 *
 * Idempotency
 * - Re-running a calibration overwrites that channel’s EEPROM record with the newest values.
