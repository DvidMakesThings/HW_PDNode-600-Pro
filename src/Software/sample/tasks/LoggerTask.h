 * @ingroup tasks
 * @brief Centralized logging subsystem with queue-based message handling.
 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-11-06
 *
 * @details
 * This module implements a centralized logging system for the PDU firmware using
 * a FreeRTOS task and message queue architecture. It provides thread-safe logging
 * from any task context with optional muting capability for critical sections.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Queue-based message passing decouples log generation from output
 * - Single consumer task (LoggerTask) handles all USB-CDC output
 * - Non-blocking sends prevent logging from blocking application tasks
 * - Configurable queue depth and message size
 * - Mute functionality for reducing noise during debug operations
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Thread-safe logging from any task or ISR context
 * - Printf-style formatting with variadic arguments
 * - Automatic message truncation to prevent buffer overflows
 * - Non-blocking queue operations (messages dropped if queue full)
 * - Nested mute/unmute support for critical sections
 * - Force-log capability to bypass mute state
 * - Integrated with health monitoring for watchdog supervision
 *
 * Usage Pattern:
 * 1. Initialize early in boot sequence via LoggerTask_Init(true)
 * 2. Use log_printf() from any task for normal logging
 * 3. Use Logger_MutePush()/MutePop() to temporarily suppress logs
 * 4. Use log_printf_force() to log even when muted
 *
 * Output:
 * - All logs directed to USB-CDC (stdout via stdio_init_all)
 * - 1-second delay after init for USB enumeration
 * - Immediate console availability for early boot diagnostics
 *
 * @note LoggerTask should be initialized first in boot sequence to capture
 *       all subsequent initialization logs.
 * @note Messages are truncated to LOGGER_MSG_MAX bytes if too long.
 * @note Queue full condition silently drops messages (check LOGGER_QUEUE_LEN).

 * @note Idempotent: safe to call multiple times, creates resources only once.
 * @note Logs error codes to error logger on failure (if error logger available).
