 * @defgroup tasks08 8. Overcurrent Protection Module
 * @ingroup tasks
 * @brief High-priority overcurrent monitoring and protection system.
 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-12-11
 *
 * @details
 * This module provides real-time overcurrent protection for the ENERGIS PDU.
 * It monitors the total current draw across all 8 channels and implements
 * a tiered response system:
 *
 * **Threshold Levels (relative to ENERGIS_CURRENT_LIMIT_A):**
 * - WARNING (Limit - 1.0A): Raises ERR_SEV_ERROR, logs warning
 * - CRITICAL (Limit - 0.25A): Raises ERR_FATAL_ERROR, trips last channel, locks switching
 * - RECOVERY (Limit - 2.0A): Clears lockout when current falls below this level
 *
 * **Regional Limits:**
 * - EU Version: 10.0A (IEC/ENEC)
 * - US Version: 15.0A (UL/CSA)
 *
 * **Architecture:**
 * - MeterTask calls Overcurrent_Update() after each complete 8-channel measurement cycle
 * - SwitchTask queries Overcurrent_IsSwitchingAllowed() before executing relay commands
 * - All control handlers (HTTP, SNMP, Console) receive rejection when locked out
