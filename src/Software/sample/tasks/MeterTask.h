 * @ingroup tasks
 * @brief Power metering and system telemetry monitoring task with HLW8032 interface.
 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.1.0
 * @date 2025-11-15
 *
 * @details
 * This module implements a FreeRTOS task for power monitoring and system telemetry
 * collection. It is the exclusive owner of the HLW8032 power measurement peripheral
 * and the RP2040 ADC subsystem, providing centralized measurement data to other tasks.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Single-owner model: MeterTask has exclusive access to HLW8032 and ADC hardware
 * - Polls HLW8032 at 25 Hz in round-robin fashion across 8 relay channels
 * - Samples system ADC telemetry at 5 Hz (die temperature, VUSB, 12V supply)
 * - Publishes power measurements via FreeRTOS queue for consumer tasks
 * - Maintains cached telemetry accessible via non-blocking getter APIs
 * - Implements energy accumulation in kWh and relay uptime tracking
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Per-channel power measurements (voltage, current, active power, power factor)
 * - Energy accumulation with millisecond-resolution integration
 * - Relay uptime tracking per channel
 * - System health monitoring (die temperature, supply voltages)
 * - Standby mode support: pauses measurements to reduce CPU load
 * - Configurable per-device temperature calibration (1-point and 2-point)
 * - Overcurrent protection integration with real-time current summation
 * - Thread-safe telemetry access without blocking measurement loop
 *
 * Measurement Flow:
 * 1. HLW8032 polling: 40ms period, 8 channels × ~5ms each
 * 2. Instantaneous values cached per-channel after each poll slice
 * 3. Energy integration: power × time accumulated in kWh
 * 4. Power factor calculation: P / (V × I) clamped to [0, 1]
 * 5. Telemetry publication: every 5th sample (~200ms) to queue
 * 6. ADC sampling: 200ms period for system telemetry (temp, voltages)
 *
 * Standby Mode Behavior:
 * - When system enters standby via Power_EnterStandby():
 *   - Stops all HLW8032 polling to prevent relay state queries
 *   - Stops ADC sampling to reduce power consumption
 *   - Maintains heartbeat at reduced rate (500ms) for watchdog
 * - On exit from standby via Power_ExitStandby():
 *   - Detects state transition and resumes normal operation
 *
 * Temperature Calibration:
 * - Supports uncalibrated mode (RP2040 typical values)
 * - Single-point calibration: adjusts offset at known ambient temperature
 * - Two-point calibration: derives slope and intercept from two references
 * - Calibration parameters persisted to EEPROM and loaded at boot
 * - API provides compute and apply functions for calibration workflow
 *
 * Usage Pattern:
 * 1. Call MeterTask_Init(true) during system initialization (after NetTask)
 * 2. Query readiness via Meter_IsReady() before accessing telemetry
 * 3. Use MeterTask_GetTelemetry() for per-channel measurements (non-blocking)
 * 4. Use MeterTask_GetSystemTelemetry() for ADC values (non-blocking)
 * 5. Optional: set calibration with MeterTask_SetTempCalibration() after EEPROM load
 * 6. Consumer tasks can read from q_meter_telemetry queue or use getter APIs
 *
 * Integration Points:
 * - HLW8032 driver: exclusive owner, calls hlw8032_poll_once() in loop
 * - Overcurrent protection: updates OCP module with total current each cycle
 * - Power manager: respects standby mode to stop measurements
 * - Health monitor: sends heartbeat at configured interval
 * - EEPROM storage: loads/stores temperature calibration parameters
 *
 * @note MeterTask must be initialized after NetTask due to deterministic sequencing.
 * @note No other task should access ADC or HLW8032 hardware directly.
 * @note Telemetry queue depth is 16 samples; older data discarded if consumers lag.
 * @note Energy accumulation starts from zero at boot and persists during runtime only.
