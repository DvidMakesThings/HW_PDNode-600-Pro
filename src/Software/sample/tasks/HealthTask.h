 * @ingroup tasks
 * @brief System health monitor: watchdog, heartbeats, diagnostics (reset-safe).
 * @{
 *
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025-11-06
 *
 * @details Implements a FreeRTOS-based health monitoring task that manages the
 * hardware watchdog, tracks heartbeats from registered tasks, logs diagnostics,
 * and records long blocking events for post-mortem analysis.
 * Key behavior:
 *  - Graceful ARMING: watchdog is enabled only after a warmup period and after
 *    at least one heartbeat from each registered task (or warmup timeout).
 *  - LIVENESS WINDOW: each task must heartbeat at least once within
 *    HEALTH_SILENCE_MS; otherwise the watchdog is NOT fed.
 *  - DIAGNOSTICS: prints stack high-water marks and free heap periodically,
 *    and keeps a small ring of "blocked" events for post-mortem.
 *
 * Integration:
 *  1) Call Health_RegisterTask(id, handle, "name") after xTaskCreate for each task.
 *  2) Call HealthTask_Start() once everything is created (at end of InitTask).
 *  3) Inside each task loop, call Health_Heartbeat(HEALTH_ID_xxx) once per loop.
 *  4) Optionally call Health_RecordBlocked("tag", waited_ms) on long waits.
 *
 * @note Do NOT arm another watchdog elsewhere. Let HealthTask manage it.
 * You can adjust HEALTH_WARMUP_MS and HEALTH_SILENCE_MS below.
