# PDNode 600 Pro  
## High-Performance USB PD Power Distribution Unit – 10" Rackmount

![Hardware Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Ongoing-orange)

## Description  
[ENERGIS](https://github.com/DvidMakesThings/HW_10-In-Rack_PDU) is the 230V managed PDU project. PDNode-600 Pro is the modular DC/USB-C sibling for setups
where mains switching is not desired, but controllable, rack-friendly power output is still needed.

The PDNode-600 is a professional-grade, 600W USB Power Delivery Unit designed specifically for compact 10-inch rack systems, targeting embedded developers, homelab enthusiasts, test benches, and smart infrastructure. It delivers regulated, high-current power across 8x independent USB-C PD outputs and 4x fixed 5V USB-A outputs.

At the core of the PDNode platform is a centralized industrial-grade 24V/25A power supply, distributing regulated DC to dedicated per-port buck or buck-boost converters. Each USB-C port is managed by an MCP22350T-2I/Q8X PD controller, enabling clean, autonomous negotiation of power profiles up to 20V @ 3A or 5V @ 5A with eMarker cable support. All power conversion, protection, and monitoring are designed to meet high reliability and safety standards.

The PDNode-600 Pro, by contrast, is built for remote-managed racks and headless environments, featuring Ethernet connectivity, a clean web-based UI, SNMP integration, and firmware updates via USB-C.

## Specifications 

### Input
- **Input voltage:** 230 VAC, max 4A 
- **System topology:** 24V distribution on the baseboard, per-slot conversion on PD cards

### Output (per PD card / per slot)
- **8x independent USB-C PD source**:
  - 5V 3A
  - 9V 3A
  - 12V 3A
  - 15V 3A
  - 20V 3A
  - 5V 5A (only with 5A e-marked cable)
  - 20V 5A (only with 5A e-marked cable)

---

## Features
- **8x independent USB-C PD source ports** (modular PD cards, one port per slot)
- **Per-port PD profiles**
- **Total system capability: up to 600W** (shared input power budget)
- **4x USB-A auxiliary outputs** (5V, 1A per port) for low-power devices
- **Ethernet connectivity** for control / monitoring
- **USB service interface** (debug, configuration, firmware update, or log access depending on implementation)
- **Per-port power monitoring** (current/voltage telemetry via onboard sensing)
- **Per-port status reporting** (PGOOD / fault indication, and software-readable status)
- **Hot-swappable slot concept** (cards can be replaced without redesigning the baseboard)

---

## Hardware architecture

### Baseboard
- 24V DC input from industrial power supply
- Power distribution to all slots (high-current bus)
- Slot connectors + slot management (card detect, enable, status aggregation)
- I2C fanout per slot (mux) for monitoring and controlling devices
- Ethernet interface for user interaction
- USB/service interface for debug/config/updates
- 4x USB-A outputs
- 8x USB-C PD outputs

### PD Card
- 1x USB-C PD source port (one card = one port)
- Local power conversion to generate VBUS from the 24V bus
- PD controller + USB-C port control signals (enable, reset, IRQ)
- Per-port current/voltage measurement
- Per-port power good / fault status output
- Optional ID EEPROM footprint (DNI) for traceability/calibration
